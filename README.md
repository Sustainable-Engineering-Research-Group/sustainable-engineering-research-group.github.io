## Keeping up with the literature

-   Subscribe to journal table of contents from their websites. Journals
    with articles relevant to the group's work include, but are not
    limited to the following.

    -   Environmental Science and Technology

    -   ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering

    -   Resources, Conservation and Recycling

    -   Journal of Cleaner Production

    -   Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy

    -   Journal of Industrial Ecology

    -   International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment

    -   AIChE Journal

    -   Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research

    -   Computers and Chemical Engineering

    -   Science

    -   Nature

    -   Nature Sustainability

    -   Nature Climate Change

    -   Nature Energy

    -   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

    -   Energy and Environmental Science

    -   Science of the Total Environment

    -   Ecological Modelling

    -   Ecological Indicators

    -   Ecosystem Services

    -   IPCC reports (ipcc.ch)

-   Set up keyword searches in the ISI citation index or Google Scholar.

-   READ, READ, READ, and READ ... You *must* read *all* the literature
    that is directly and indirectly related to your work. In the early
    years, even if you have a full course load, you should be reading
    and understanding 1-2 papers a week. Without courses, it should be
    more. My most common observation (and complaint) is that students
    don't read enough.

-   It is also a good idea to follow some academic and non-academic
    literature that may be peripherally related to your work. Often, new
    ideas come from unexpected sources.

Writing papers
--------------

During your research you will write documents such as short reports,
journal manuscripts, and your thesis. The typical content of such
documents that are reporting new findings is organized as follows.

Title

Abstract (write this last)

-   Introduction (start with an initial draft, but finalize at the end)

    -   The problem being addressed in your work and its importance,

    -   Previous related work and its shortcomings, which should
        motivate your work,

    -   Objectives and contributions of your work. These need to be
        stated explicitly and directly. The contributions should
        describe the novelty of your work, how it is moving the field
        forward, and how it will advance the research field. Think of
        the stakeholders who will benefit from the work.

    -   The last paragraph of the introduction should describe the
        structure of the rest of the document.

-   Background

    -   This section may be included if your work is relying on methods
        that already exist, but the audience may not be very familiar
        with them.

    -   In case of length limitations, this section could be in the
        Supporting Information.

    -   A thesis must have a detailed background of all methods relevant
        to your work.

-   Methods

    -   You will need to describe your work in enough detail such that
        someone else can reproduce it. This may involve providing a
        high-level description in the main manuscript with all the gory
        details and relevant data in the Supporting Information.

    -   There is nothing like too much detail. Most people fail to
        include enough details about their approach.

-   Results

    -   It is often a good idea to prepare your results before anything
        else and then build the rest of the paper around it.

    -   Prepare the key figures and plots. In their final form, they
        must be professional. Pay attention to the font size, sharpness,
        and clarity. Ideally, a figure can be understood without reading
        any text.

-   Conclusions and Discussion

-   Bibliography

-   Supporting Information and code

    -   This needs to be detailed enough so that the reader can
        reproduce your results without much effort.

**How to write**

-   Writing is not easy. Often, getting started is the hardest part. It
    is best to start writing the part that is easiest to write. This
    could be the approach or results.

-   Preparing figures that convey your results well must be done before
    starting to write. Compelling figures can allow you to organize the
    rest of the paper around them.

-   It is also a very good idea to write a detailed outline of your
    paper before writing any text. This outline should have names of
    sections and subsections and one or two sentences per subsection.

-   When you start writing, you could just do a "brain dump". Don't
    worry about the language and whether the ideas and thoughts are
    being articulated in the best manner. Just get everything down on
    paper and then refine, rewrite, and polish.

The advice on [How to Write a Technical
Paper](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/write-technical-paper.html)
by Michael Ernst is worth reading and following.

## Use LaTeX

-   Use LaTeX defaults for almost everything, especially figures,
    > tables, font and other styles. Make the margins 1 inch.

-   

## Making presentations

## Ensuring reproducibility
